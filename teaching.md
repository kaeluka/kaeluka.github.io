*I have been tasked to write up a "Teaching Philosophy", a statement
that summarises what I care about and how I see myself as a
teacher. In order to keep myself honest, and as an experiment, I'm
publishing it here.*

### I Love My Work,

.. and (as Carl Sagan supposedly said) "when you're in love, you want
to tell the world". My goal will always be to *make people care* as
much as I do, rather than to hammer facts into their heads. Caring
for something, to me, requires a deep understanding -- and this is
why I prefer to go slower than I planned, rather than just gloss over
important basics.

### I Have High Expectations,

.. but "high" is relative. For some, passing a math course is an
achievement; for others, it is to communicate well in a project; and
for others yet, it means to have the courage to speak up in front of
a large class room. I have struggled with all these, and I was lucky
to have teachers that motivated me. My goal is to be that teacher,
too. Although you can expect to find *constructive* criticism in my
class room, you will not find me holding grudges.

### I Value Interaction,

.. and as much as I'm trying ty teach others how to learn, I'm also
learning how to teach. Therefore, I want to create an atmosphere
where people feel free to speak up at any time. Am I wrong? Interrupt
and correct me! Am I going too fast? Tell me. Have you noticed I'm
violating my teaching philosophy? Call me out on it. Am I
misunderstanding what you just said? You get the drill.
