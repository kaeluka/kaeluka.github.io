I just finished a set of slides for my course on academic teaching. They
describe a part of "Imperative and Object-oriented Programming Methodology"
(IOOPM), a course I am a TA for. In IOOPM we take feedback from students and
teaching staff very seriously in order to improve the course. It seems to be
working.
