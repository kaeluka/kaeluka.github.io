# Abstract

Collections are commonly implemented as libraries by data structure experts, and
are relied on heavily by application developers. The expert’s task is to
implement a wide range of collections, and the application developer’s task is
to pick an appropriate collection for each usage scenario. The design space for
collections is huge, as data structures in practice implement not only their
semantics, but also several performance-related concerns like memory layout,
synchronisation, and (im)mutability.

This paper presents C♭, pronounced “C-flat”, a novel way to implement
collections that lets experts implement the semantics of a collection data
structure, in a way that is decoupled from its data representation. This
simplifies collection implementation, and allows a collection’s performance to
be tuned, for example, moving from a dense to a sparse representation, without
changing its abstract specification.

We describe C♭, both abstractly and in terms of a specific prototype
implementation in Java. We use our prototype implementation to show that C♭ is
expressive enough to implement common collections, that the code is
straightforward, and that the performance of C♭ collections is close to Java’s
standard collections for most operations, and much higher for some.
