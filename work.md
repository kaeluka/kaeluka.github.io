I was a PhD student at <a href="http://www.uu.se" target="_blank">Uppsala
University</a>, Sweden. My advisor was <a
href="http://www.it.uu.se/katalog/writo649" target="_blank">Tobias Wrigstad</a>,
my co-advisor was <a href="http://www.it.uu.se/katalog/davcl820"
target="_blank">Dave Clarke</a>. 

I'm was working on several projects:

 1. In the Structured Aliasing project (my main project), we developed
   Disjointness
   Domains
   [(Abstract, Slides, Preprint)]({{ site.baseurl }}/Disjointness-Domains-for-Fine-Grained-Aliasing),
   a novel type abstraction for alias control. 
 2. I have built [Spencer]({{ site.baseurl }}/spencer), a tool that makes it
   trivial for a wider audience to get insights about the behaviour of programs
   running on the JVM.
 3. I have built C♭, a domain-specific language to develop tree-like data
    structures that can be easily specialised, modularly and at runtime, to
    achieve performance close to (and sometimes much better for our
    micro-benchmarks) data structures that are much more heavily optimised
    [(Abstract, Preprint, Paper)]({{ site.baseurl }}/cflat).
 3. In the UPSCALE project, I have worked on the compiler and the runtime of the
   parallel OO+functional language called 'Encore' [(Abstract, Preprint,
   Paper)]({{ site.baseurl }}/Encore-Glimpse).

# Supervision

  1. I supervised Erik Fransson's bachelor thesis project on implementing
     asynchronous IO in Encore.
